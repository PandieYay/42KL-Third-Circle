# 42KL-Third-Circle

Philosophers: A really cool project, once you understand the logic behind the question, programming it is not that hard. Unless you are doing bonus which doesn't allow you to use mutex lock, making data race very hard to avoid. I personally solved it by pre-calculating instead of checking the variables directly.

minishell: Pain, very repititive and a lot of edge cases. But it's good at teaching you the shell commands, how they work, and the whole enviorment of it. One of the projects in 42 of all time.
